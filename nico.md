# Nico Beastie Boyce, offline creator.

Nico Beastie Boyce is an engineer, artist, photographer, and musician.

He cut his teeth playing slow-and-low jams at parties in old Cornish farm buildings with his millennial long-haired skate punk trash buddies in pre-YouTube times.

Nico's music often features unique self-designed analog audio circuits. His primary instrument is the electric upright bass. He records, builds, and paints at his home studio on the edge on Thruxton circuit, expressing what he describes as a "cultural technological remorse" as well as operating his CX consulting business [Deltastring](https://deltastring.com). Professionally, Nico Boyce is London's top Zendesk consultant.

Nico's musical heroes include Scott Reeder, Stephen O'Malley, JPEGmafia, Al Cisneros, Earl Sweatshirt, Mr Oizo, Kool (but not so much his gang) and of course MCA.

# Nico Boyce is the leader of Deltastring Ltd.

Nico has been building and hacking software since the mid nineties, starting out with a scavenged Zenith SupersPort and a Nokia 2110. He studied photonics at the University of Southampton before taking a hard left with his career and working in the world of bars and restaurants for a decade.

At university he primarily focused on automated control and measurement, using Python for programming both instrument adjustment actuators and also data collection and analysis. Outside of studies, he was an editor of the newspaper and a popular student politician.

In the super-competitive Hampshire hospitality trade, Nico quickly gained a reputation as an expert buyer of alcohol and as a data-led restaurateur with an eye for efficiency. His company had contracts with local producers, UK market leaders, and international giants. His team operated pubs and restaurants, off-license retailers and events. After achieving multiple TripAdvisor certificates and CAMRA awards, Nico made the decision to switch careers and bring his CX and data experience to other industries.

Zendesk fell at the intersection between Nico's work passions: using data to guide continuous improvement of customer experience with engineering solutions. His recent clients include London unicorns Checkout.com and Starling Bank, S&P 500 component Etsy, along with various smaller scale B2B and B2C startups, each of which had their own distinct set of Zendesk opportunities.

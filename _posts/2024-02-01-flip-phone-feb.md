I've been curious about [Flip Phone February](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Quit-Your-Smartphone-The-New-York-Times-36d2c019930e4f3b97d5432a55363f9b?pvs=21), and not only because ditching the apps apparently merits yet another alliterative month. On paper I should be all over this like tech contractors on client’s swag. In reality, though? It’s as mad as Apple Vision.

My fascination with portable computing has been a lifelong affair<!--excerpt-end-->. In my childhood, one of my most treasured possessions was a [1988 Zenith SupersPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_SupersPort), and I often daydreamed about owning a [9000 series Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_9000_Communicator) someday. During my teenage years, my Dell Inspiron was my entire world (actually I recently got my hands on another 2004 Inspiron, still a great device) and I still occasionally boot Marvin, my 2008 Acer Aspire One A150L. I guess I have around 30 computers of various kinds in various stages of disassembly.

I also have and occasionally boot up most of my past smartphones, including a 2010 HTC Desire, the first-gen Moto G, Nexus 6P, BlackBerry Classic, and various other OnePlus and Huawei models. It's an interesting cross-section of Android history, though with a peculiar aversion to Samsung.

I've experimented with different form factors. I pre-ordered the Moto 360 watch in 2014, but that device was far from consumer-ready so I quickly sold it. VR, for the most part, has passed me by, but I can't deny I am itching to get my face in an Apple Vision Pro. Indisputably, I have been a lifelong devotee to battery-powered computing. But the smartphone itself? It’s time to go.

### Three reasons to drop the droid

Firstly, being constantly available to anyone who knows how to reach me is incredibly convenient for them, but ultimately, it becomes a burden on me. Fixing your Zendesk integration at 3 am might be doable, but it's not ideal for me or my family. I'll have to remember to include a charge for that in my next contract. Sometimes, I do actually need to be unavailable.

Secondly, phones have reached a point where they do everything, but they do these things precisely well enough. I can listen to music, but I would never choose my phone over my headphone amplifier. I can take a photo, but I would always get a better shot with my Nikon SLR. I can send an email, but typing on screens is and always will be a hopeless, so I'll grab my MacBook Pro for anything longer than a sentence. Even taking a call, ostensibly the prime purpose of the device, is rubbish. If I could just insert a SIM card into, say, some Sony XM4s, then I would definitely do that. Well, probably not XM4s because the microphones are appalling on those, but you get the idea. Holding a phone to your face is annoying and interferes with using your hands. Putting it on speaker is horrible for everyone around you. Essentially, I can do most things with my phone, but would rather avoid it in any specific circumstance. There are better alternatives for every single task it performs.

Thirdly, it puts a distance between myself and the people I'm actually spending time with. Fellow parents, let's be honest; your phone is mostly a barrier you put in front of your face when you need a moment away from your child and their needs. I don't need to check Hacker News when I'm having lunch with a friend. Who cares what Corpsegrinder just posted on Instagram while we're watching a film? Actually that’s a bad example, his posts are excellent.

These three points have led to a severe case of device fatigue for me. When someone calls me, I'm invariably unhappy to receive that call. When I want to do something and the available device is a phone, I'm frustrated with its limitations. Yet, when I'm seeking meaningful experiences, it nags at my psyche, demanding I divert attention to it rather than experiencing the world around me.

### If only it was so simple

There we have our dichotomy. On one side, there's this craving to simplify life, to drop the constant connection. But the reality is there is often a requirement to stay in the loop. I can’t miss a call from my son’s school, or mute the notifications from my Zendesk clients, so I maintain the addiction to the device which feeds back into how I spend my leisure time.

Simplifying life sounds like a great plan until you realise life doesn’t always play by your rules. I can dream of an offline utopia all day, but when it comes down to it, I've got responsibilities that don’t give a damn about my tech preferences. Trying to tell clients or the school how to contact me? I can’t dictate to them, however much I would wish to ditch WhatsApp or Slack. The smartphone might be a pain, but it is for now a necessary evil.
